# bubbles
Neon kinda bubbles that merge into one another. Makes for a kind of intereseting screensaver. There are a number of parameters - they're currently set to a pretty stable state. Decrease loss / increase some defaults for more action.

Here is a screenshot with bubbles in neon mode, with a couple of extra mayhem bubbles added on top of defaults:
