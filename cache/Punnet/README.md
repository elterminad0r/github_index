# Punnet Squares
Some leftover code for Punnet square generation, from a stackoverflow question. The question was deleted, so I decided to see how illegible I could make my code. Was once intended to become a `code-golf` challenge, but it was too similar to another challenge. It uses some neat generator/unpacking tricks. If tokens are shortened appropriately, you can get this to be pretty short.

`$ python code.py Xx xx`
