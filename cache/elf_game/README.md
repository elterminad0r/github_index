# elf\_game
A framework for simulating the elf game, allowing for testing, analysis and
evaluation of different strategies.  `sim_game.py` is an OOP framework to
perform the simulation. `stats.py` calculates statistics about the distribution
of money earned, and the other files are implementers. 

Also featured are some shell scripts/makefiles to synthesise/present generated
data.
