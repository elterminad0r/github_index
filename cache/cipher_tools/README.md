# cipher\_tools
A collection of programs to aid in cipher-cracking/cryptanalysis. If you use
this and you're not a GW appreciator you're a disappointment and need to
re-evaluate your life (beware as `eval` is unsafe). Please note:

“In submitting an entry solo entrants vouch that it is solely their own work
and teams warrant that it is solely their own collective work.”

Currently features, among other things:

 - Pretty fully fledged textual interface, with exception handling and a
   functional model for commands/functions
 - Frequency analysis (including IOC calculation)
 - Substitution
 - Some facilities for polyalphabetic analysis
 - Analysis of frequently occurring runs of letters
 - Hints for unsubstituted letters
 - Display of expected frequency analysis
 - Substitution table histories
 - Utility to split an unpunctuated text into words, featuring blacklisting,
   whitelisting and space hinting

These are, as it stands, text-based interfaces. Hopefully it should be possible
to paste in input. They rely on an installation of Python 3 (I recommend 3.6).
They might be runnable by clicking the script from a file explorer?

Notice: sometimes I find catastrophic bugs, fix them and don't tell anyone.
This is absolutely my fault and I'll try to stop doing this but in the meantime
please make sure your version is up to date.

You can obtain the scripts by downloading them, pasting them in, or even
cloning them if you're feeling really enthusiastic. (NB the scripts are all in
the `src` directory.)

Here is a quick guide to installation and execution:

 - Install Python 3.6 and, by extension, Idle from
   https://www.python.org/downloads/. This should be pretty well documented
   across the web.
 - Download this repository (click Clone or download, and then "Download ZIP").
   You will probably need to unzip it. Don't make any changes to the files.
 - Navigate to `src/` in the repository in the file explorer of your choice
 - Click/double click on `text_interface.py` to run it.

You probably can run it from IDLE, but I would not recommend, as IDLE does not
provide some of the terminal features used (eg it breaks automatic width
detection)

If you're a command line user, you can safely ignore and just clone and pull,
and run `text_interface` from the CLI.

For more on how `text_interface.py` works, see
[this](https://github.com/goedel-gang/cipher_tools/blob/master/text_interface_doc.md)
MD file.

For documentation on each function, see
[this](https://github.com/goedel-gang/cipher_tools/blob/master/action_doc.md)
MD file.

For fledgling documentation on `splitting_words`, see
[this](https://github.com/goedel-gang/cipher_tools/blob/master/splitting_doc.md)
MD file. This is probably not useful to anyone because (1) it's illegible (2)
it only works from a terminal prompt.

You can also try looking at the source files in `src` - they're now pretty well
documented inline. This will be more technical, terse, and may require some
knowledge of Python but is guaranteed to be up to date.
