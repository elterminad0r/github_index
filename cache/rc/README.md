# rc
A collection of copies of my rc files for easier access. They're not particularly pretty - I haven't put much effort into them. Generally, I'm satisfied to use what works. I'm happy enough to introduce obscure aliases I'll forget though. `vimrc` contains a number of things specific to my terminal.

I use `izaak-zshrc` for my `rc` file for `zsh`, as to allow `oh-my-zsh`'s default file to be preserved/keep my file safe. It contains a preposterous volume of aliases, beware.

I have two email accounts set up with `mutt`, with obscured passwords. `gmail` is aliases to load my `gmail` credentials, etc. I've emulated `muttrc` syntax with a `sh` shebang.
