# DNA
My various projects from my brief work experience at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, where I did a project on error-correction in DNA strings. Features various approaches, including Hadamard codes moved forcibly to base-4, and a base-4 adaptation of the Hamming code, where parity is extended into value-mod-4.

It also has some simple Python CGI scripts implementing some of the found approaches in a very simplistic web interface.

[Here](https://github.com/goedel-gang/DNA/blob/master/presentation.pdf) is the accompanying presentation I made for the end of my stay.

It's somewhere around the middle of my well-populated to-do list to revisit this and clean it up.
